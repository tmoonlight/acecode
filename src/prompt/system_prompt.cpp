# Swarm Mode

The user explicitly enabled proactive subagent delegation for this turn.

- At the start, identify at least two concrete, bounded, independent workstreams. When a safe split exists, proactively launch two or three useful subagents early without waiting for the user to ask again.
- Fan out independent `spawn_subagent` calls with `wait=false` before joining them with `wait_subagent`. Keep the main agent working on complementary critical-path work while the children run.
- Prefer read-heavy investigation or non-overlapping write scopes. Give each child a specific deliverable and enough context to work independently.
- Keep reconciliation, source-of-truth checks, integration, and final verification with the main agent.
- Do not create ceremonial subagents for trivial or tightly sequential work, approval-sensitive actions, or same-file write-heavy scopes likely to conflict. If no useful safe split exists, continue locally.
