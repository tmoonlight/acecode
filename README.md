ACECode is a C++17 AI coding agent for the terminal. It provides an FTXUI-based TUI, provider support for GitHub Copilot and OpenAI-compatible APIs, tool calling for repository work, session persistence, a daemon HTTP/WebSocket API, a React web UI, and an optional desktop shell.

## Features

- Interactive terminal UI with streaming responses, input history, scrollable chat, markdown rendering, and live tool progress.
- Multi-turn agent loop with tool calls, permission prompts, cancellation, compaction, rewind, and resumable sessions.
- Provider support for GitHub Copilot device-flow auth and OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoints.
- Built-in repository tools for shell execution, file reads/writes/edits, search, globbing, user questions, skills, memory, and optional web search.
- Daemon mode with HTTP/WebSocket endpoints, token-protected non-loopback access, and a bundled React/Vite web UI.
- Optional desktop shell that can manage multiple workspaces through separate daemon processes.
- Cross-platform build support for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Build From Source

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.20 or newer.
- Ninja or another supported CMake generator.
- A C++17 compiler: MSVC 2019+, GCC 9+, or Clang 10+.
- Git with submodule support.
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
- `pnpm` when building the embedded web UI.

Set `<triplet>` to one of the supported vcpkg triplets:

| Platform | Triplet |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x64 | `x64-linux` |
| Linux arm64 | `arm64-linux` |
| Windows x64 | `x64-windows-static` |
| macOS x64 | `x64-osx` |
| macOS arm64 | `arm64-osx` |

### Web UI

CMake embeds the frontend from `web/dist/`. Build the Web UI before running `cmake -S ...` when you want the daemon to serve the full browser UI.

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm build
cd ..
```

If `web/dist/` is missing during CMake configure, the build embeds a minimal fallback page so daemon APIs can still build, but the full Web UI will not be included. See [web/README.md](web/README.md).

### Configure And Build

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg-root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=<triplet> \
  -DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=$PWD/ports \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=ON

cmake --build build --config Release
```

The main binary is `build/acecode` for single-config Ninja builds.

### Tests

```bash
cmake --build build --target acecode_unit_tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Unit tests live under `tests/` and link against the `acecode_testable` object library. TUI-heavy entry-point code stays out of the test target unless logic is isolated into reusable helpers.

### Desktop Build

Use the same supported `<triplet>` values listed above. Build [web/](web) first, then configure CMake, when the desktop shell should use the full embedded Web UI.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg-root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=<triplet> \
  -DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=$PWD/ports \
  -DACECODE_BUILD_DESKTOP=ON

cmake --build build --target acecode-desktop
```

On Linux, install the WebKitGTK development package before configuring the desktop target, for example `sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` on Ubuntu 24.04. At runtime the system WebKitGTK library is required, for example `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` on Ubuntu.

On macOS, this target produces `build/ACECode.app`. On Windows and Linux, it produces a flat layout with `acecode-desktop` and the colocated `acecode` daemon executable in the build directory.

### Windows Notes

Windows builds use UTF-8 compilation flags and default to a static vcpkg triplet when the toolchain is vcpkg and no triplet is provided. libcurl 8.14 or newer is required for Windows TLS behavior.

## Quick Start

Download a prebuilt binary from [Releases](https://github.com/shaohaozhi286/acecode/releases), then run:

```bash
./acecode configure
cd /path/to/your/project
./acecode
```

The setup wizard creates `~/.acecode/config.json`. Choose GitHub Copilot for device-flow login, or choose an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and provide `base_url`, `api_key`, and model name.

Once the TUI starts, type a request and press Enter:

```text
refactor the session serializer and add focused unit tests
```

Read-only tools normally run automatically. File writes, edits, and shell commands ask for confirmation unless the current permission mode or rules allow them.

## Running Modes

### Terminal CLI

```bash
./acecode                     # Start a fresh TUI session in the current directory
./acecode --resume            # Resume the latest session for this project
./acecode --resume <id>       # Resume a specific session
./acecode configure           # Run the setup wizard
./acecode --alt-screen        # Force alternate-screen rendering for this launch
./acecode --dangerous         # Skip permission prompts; use only in a sandbox
```

ACECode expects an interactive TTY. It is designed to be launched from the project root you want the agent to work on.

### Daemon And Web UI

```bash
./acecode daemon --foreground
./acecode daemon start
./acecode daemon status
./acecode daemon stop
```

The daemon serves the API and bundled web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:28080` by default. Configure `web.bind`, `web.port`, and `web.static_dir` in `~/.acecode/config.json`.

Runtime files live under `<data_dir>/run/`. Each daemon start writes a token file; loopback clients can connect without it, while non-loopback clients must pass `X-ACECode-Token` or a `?token=` query parameter. See [docs/daemon-api.md](docs/daemon-api.md) for the protocol.

### Windows Service

On Windows, ACECode can install the daemon as an SCM service:

```powershell
acecode service install
acecode service start
acecode service status
acecode service stop
acecode service uninstall
```

Service mode uses the platform service data directory rather than the normal user data directory, so sessions and config are separate from TUI mode.

### Desktop Shell

The optional `acecode-desktop` target wraps the web UI in a native desktop shell. It can track multiple workspaces through a shared daemon process. Build it with `-DACECODE_BUILD_DESKTOP=ON`; on Linux it uses WebKitGTK through `webview/webview`. See [docs/desktop-shell/multi-workspace.md](docs/desktop-shell/multi-workspace.md) for the current model.

## Configuration Highlights

Primary config lives at `~/.acecode/config.json`. User data also includes Copilot tokens, session metadata, input history, memory files, runtime daemon files, and state under `~/.acecode/`.

Important config areas:

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `provider`, `openai`, `copilot` | Legacy provider selection and endpoint/model settings. |
| `saved_models`, `default_model_name` | Named model profiles and defaults. |
| `context_window`, `models_dev` | Context-window resolution and bundled models.dev lookup behavior. |
| `skills`, `memory`, `project_instructions` | Optional context sources and their limits. |
| `agent_loop.max_iterations` | Hard cap for one agent turn. |
| `daemon`, `web` | Daemon heartbeat, service, bind, port, and static asset settings. |
| `network` | System/manual proxy behavior, proxy probing, and TLS options. |
| `web_search` | Web-search tool enablement and backend choice. |
| `tui.alt_screen_mode` | Terminal rendering mode. |
| `desktop.notifications` | Desktop shell notification behavior. |
| `mcp_servers` | Stdio, SSE, or Streamable HTTP MCP server definitions. |

Model selection details are documented in [docs/model-context-resolution.md](docs/model-context-resolution.md).
